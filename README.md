This repository contains scripts to help parallelize long-duration neuroscience processes and programs which are commonplace in the
Department of Psychiatry, as well as provide supplementary scripts which allow administrators better control over the local Slurm cluster.

Scripts are categorized into folders pertaining to their own relevant softwares, commonly replacing stock scripts.

Modification is almost certainly required.

Note: When I have more time, I'll package up our FSL/FreeSurfer Slurm stuff for easier access so that others might be able to easier adapt
our systems!
